# HealthKart-Intern-Assignment'25
# HealthKart Influencer Campaign Dashboard💪

Hey there! 👋  
This project is my take on making sense of how influencers help drive results for HealthKart. It’s not just about pretty charts — it’s about understanding where the money’s going, who’s delivering results, and how we can make smarter marketing decisions.

## 📘 What’s Inside?

- 📋 A clean Excel Dashboard packed with visual insights
- 📊 Pivot Tables to explore campaign data
- 🧮 ROI, ROAS, engagement analysis — all under one sheet!
- 🎯 A data-driven approach to evaluating influencer impact

## 🧠 Assumptions I Made

To keep things focused and realistic, here are a few assumptions:

1. Influencers are paid either per **post** or per **order**.
2. Revenue & engagement are matched based on influencer and date.
3. One post = one campaign (to simplify tracking).
4. Follower count is used as a proxy for audience weight.
5. Engagement (likes/comments) is directional, not directly tied to revenue.

## 🛠 How to Use It

1. Download the Excel file → `HK Ruchi Assignment.xlsx`
2. Head to the `Dashboard` tab.
3. Play around with **slicers** (Name, Revenue, Reach) to filter results.
4. Dive deeper using:
   - `Merged_data` for ROI, ROAS, payouts
   - `Pivot Tables` for category/platform breakouts

## 🧾 Features You’ll Find

| Feature | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| 📌 **KPI Cards** | Total Revenue, Total Payout, Avg ROAS, Avg ROI% |
| 📊 **Bar Charts** | ROAS & ROI% by influencer |
| 🧁 **Pie Charts** | Platform and Category breakdown |
| 📍 **Scatter Plot** | Engagement vs Revenue mapping |
| 🎛️ **Slicers** | Instant filtering by Platform, Category, Gender |

## 📊 What I Found (Spoiler Alert!)

- Total revenue is **₹48,600**, while payouts are slightly higher at **₹53,400** 😬
- Some influencers really stood out — looking at you, **Nidhi Mohan Kamal (2.0 ROAS)** 👏
- Others, not so much — post-based payouts didn’t always deliver the goods.
- YouTube seems like a solid platform for driving consistent returns.

🧠 So the question is: should HealthKart re-think who they pay, and *how* they pay them?

## 💡 What Could Be Done Next?

- Consider shifting **post-based payouts → performance-based**
- Highlight top creators in future campaigns
- Drop or renegotiate low-ROI collabs
- Add more time-based analysis (monthly/quarterly ROI trends)
